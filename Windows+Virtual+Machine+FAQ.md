Do I need to activate the Windows license?

No. Activation should happen automatically, but it is not immediate and may take some time. To activate manually right click on My Computer and then click on Activate windows now. Do not try to activate the licence in any other way.
Where is my second harddrive?

The second disk in the Windows instances are not initialized. You have to use the Server Management utility to initialize the new drive and create and format a new NTFS or FAT32 partition. Please see the Windows Drive Initialization Walkthrough.zip for screenshots on this process.
