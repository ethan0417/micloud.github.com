    <p>If you&#39;re coming to a SmartMachine from Linux, you may find that some things are a little different than what you are familiar with. The SmartOS has most of the GNU tools that you are accustomed to, just that they are not default tools. Your fingers&#39; muscle memory may find the differences a little unsettling at first, but rest assured that everything you&#39;re used to is still here. It&#39;s just in a different place, or it may have a different name.</p>
<h1>Where things are</h1>
<p>Most things are where you expect them to be. The following table lists the directories you&#39;ll find in your PATH variable.</p>
<p>||Directory     ||Description<br>|/opt/local/bin</p>
<p>/opt/local/sbin   |These directories contain the GNU tools as well as other tools installed on top of the standard system tools. When you install software with pkgsrc,</p>
<p>this is where it is installed by default. On other systems, this would be /usr/local/bin.<br>|/usr/xpg4/bin     |This directory contains the basic Unix tools such as rm, ln, etc<br>|/usr/bin</p>
<p>/usr/sbin     |These directories contain standard Unix tools.<br>|/opt/SUNWspro/bin |This directory, if it exists, is for the Sun C compiler. It&#39;s not normally installed.<br>Other directories you may be interested in are:</p>
<p>||Directory     ||Description<br>|/home     |User home directories.<br>|/home/admin     |Home directory for the admin user.<br>|/home/jill     |Home of the jill user (the website owner user).<br>|/home/jill/web/public     |This is where website files reside (the &#39;document root&#39;).<br>|/shared     |If you have purchased extra NFS storage, it will be mounted here.<br>|/var/adm     |System logs. Other logs, such as httpd logs, are in /var/log.<br>|/usr/local     |This is a symlink to /opt/local.</p>
<h1>Commands that work differently</h1>
<p>The things that make a SmartMachine different from other Unix-like systems generally fall in two categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>commands that have different names on SmartMachines</li>
<li>things that are done differently on SmartMachines<br>For example, here are some common Linux commands that work differently.</li>
</ul>
<p>||Command     ||What&#39;s different on a Smart Machine<br>|df     |The default is to us the SmartOS version.  gdf may provide an output more familiar to Linux users.<br>|locate     |This is a GNU tool, so it has been renamed to glocate. Likewise, you would use gupdatedb to set up its database.<br>|lsof     |SmartMachines use a different collection of tools to examine processes. See Examining processes and memory later in this topic.<br>|ping     |Returns whether a host responds or not. Use ping -s to get the continuous response you&#39;re used to<br>|top    |top is available in /opt/local/bin, but prstat -Z provides more zone aware (and more accurate) information than top.<br>The <a href="http://bhami.com/rosetta.html">Rosetta Stone for Unix</a><br>You can find the GNU tools in /opt/local/bin and /opt/local/sbin.</p>
<p>The vmstat, mpstat, and psrinfo commands display processor and memory statistics for the physical machine. Their output is not generally useful to you as a SmartMachine operator.</p>
<p>Do we have a tip section? One thing that is really neat with SMF is that you can set it to email you when a service is halted or crashes.</p>
<p>Peter Yorke - we need a section on creating your own start-up scripts like svccfg import /opt/local/share/smf/manifest/startupscript.xml</p>
<h1>Installing Sofware</h1>
<p>There are two ways to install additional software on your SmartMachine:</p>
<ul>
<li>install it from a package</li>
<li>compile it from source<br><strong>Installing Software From a Package</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>SmartMachines have a package manager like Debian (apt) or Redhat (rpm,yum) called pkgsrc to manage the installation of additional software. Joyent maintains a package repository of packages that are compatible with SmartMachines. The pkgin tool is the easiest way to work with packages.</p>
<p>This table lists the common pkgin commands. You need to run the commands that install software or update the package database as root or with sudo.</p>
<p>||Command     ||Description<br>|pkgin up     |Brings pkgin&#39;s database up to date. It&#39;s a good idea to run this command |before installing new packages.<br>|pkgin ls     |Lists all the installed packages<br>|pkgin av     |Lists all of the available packages<br>|pkgin in     |Installs a package<br>|pkgin rm     |Removes a package<br>|pkgin se     |Searches for a package<br>|pkgin             |With no additional arugments, lists all of the available pkgin commands.<br>For example, to install tidy, a utility that cleans up HTML code, you would do this:</p>
<pre><code>sudo pkgin update
sudo pkgin in tidy</code></pre>
<p><strong>Compiling Software From Source</strong><br>If the software you want to use isn&#39;t available as a prebuilt package, you can compile it from source. Typically, you&#39;ll get a tarball that contains the software you want to install. After you unpack the tarball, the readme file will contain instructions for compiling the software.</p>
<p>For example, to install the lastest version of Ruby on your SmartMachine, you would use the following commands. Note that we&#39;re using the GNU versions of tar and make.</p>
<pre><code>1. wget ftp://ftp.ruby-lang.org//pub/ruby/1.9/ruby-1.9.2-p0.tar.gz
2. gtar xvzf ruby-1.9.2-p0.tar.gz
3. cd ruby-1.9.2-p0
4. ./configure
5. gmake
6. ls
7. sudo gmake install
8. ruby -v</code></pre>
<p>External Links<br>Some really good links that we have found that make the SmartOS more familiar.</p>
